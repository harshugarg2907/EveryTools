## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated blue (#29ABE2) for trustworthiness and clarity. Its brightness ensures that the primary color contrasts with a background of the selected dark scheme.
- Background color: Dark desaturated blue (#2B3035) for a professional, modern look, promoting focus. It enhances readability by providing a strong contrast.
- Accent color: A vibrant cyan (#00FFFF), located approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' of blue on the color wheel. The accent hue is significantly different from the primary hue in both brightness and saturation to create a strong contrast, guiding user attention to interactive elements and important information.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use simple, minimalist icons to represent each tool category. Icons should be consistent in style and easily recognizable.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout. Tools should be easily accessible, with clear labeling and instructions.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback and enhance user experience, such as progress bars during file conversions.
